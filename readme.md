# Synthetic Hospital Data Generation for "Top 20 dataset to be displayed on a dashboard for a hospital administrator in developing country"

This project generates synthetic data for a hospital in a developing country, focusing on creating datasets that align with FHIR standards. These datasets can be used to analyze various hospital metrics to aid in administrative decision making. Here's a brief summary of the datasets we've generated:

1. **Number of patients**: We created a synthetic patient dataset using the `generate_patient_data` function. The data was saved under the key `patients`.

2. **Number of new admissions and length of stay**: This information is encapsulated in the encounter dataset, which represents hospital admissions. This was generated using the `generate_encounter_data` function and saved under the key `encounters`.

3. **Readmission rate**: Although we didn't directly generate readmission data, it can be derived from the encounters dataset by tracking patients with multiple encounters.

4. **Patient demographics (age, sex)**: This data is included in the patient dataset generated by the `generate_patient_data` function and saved under the key `patients`.

5. **Most common diagnoses**: These are represented in the condition dataset generated by the `generate_condition_data` function and saved under the key `conditions`.

6. **Most common procedures**: These are represented in the procedure dataset generated by the `generate_procedure_data` function and saved under the key `procedures`.

7. **Mortality rate**: While not directly generated, this could potentially be inferred from the condition and encounter datasets, depending on the specific conditions and encounter outcomes represented.

8. **Emergency department visits**: This could be a subset of the encounter dataset generated by the `generate_encounter_data` function and saved under the key `encounters`, depending on the specific encounter types represented.

9. **Wait time for appointments**: This wasn't directly generated, but could potentially be calculated from an appointment dataset, which could be generated using a modified version of the `generate_appointment_data` function and saved under the key `appointments`.

10. **Number of surgeries**: This could be represented as a subset of the procedure dataset generated by the `generate_procedure_data` function and saved under the key `procedures`.

11. **Number of ICU patients**: This could be a subset of the encounter dataset generated by the `generate_encounter_data` function and saved under the key `encounters`, depending on the specific encounter types represented.

12. **Number of outpatients**: Similar to ICU patients, this could be a subset of the encounter dataset saved under the key `encounters`.

13. **Bed occupancy rate**: This could be calculated from the location dataset generated by the `generate_location_data` function and the encounter dataset. The locations data was saved under the key `locations`.

14. **Number of staff**: This is represented in the practitioner dataset generated by the `generate_practitioner_data` function and saved under the key `practitioners`.

15. **Staff to patient ratio**: This could be calculated from the practitioner dataset (key `practitioners`) and the patient dataset (key `patients`).

16. **Vaccine administration rate**: This could be calculated from the immunization dataset generated by the `generate_immunization_data` function and saved under the key `immunizations`.

17. **Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths**: While not directly generated, these could potentially be inferred from the condition dataset (key `conditions`), depending on the specific conditions represented.

18. **Inventory status of key medical supplies**: This was not covered in the session, as it would require a different kind of FHIR resource (SupplyDelivery or similar) and additional context about which supplies to include.

In each case, remember that the datasets generated are synthetic and would need to be replaced with real data for actual analyses.
